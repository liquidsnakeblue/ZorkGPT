Instruction
Manual for
ZORK I:
The Great Underground Empire

An Overview
Interactive fiction is a story in which you are the main
character. Your own thinking and imagination determine the actions of that character and guide the story
from start to finish.
Each work of Infocomís interactive fiction, such
as the three ZORK adventures, presents you with a
series of locations, items, characters and events. You
can interact with these in a variety of ways.
To move from place to place, type the direction
you want to go. When you begin your adventure, itís
a good idea to become familiar with your surroundings by exploring every location and reading each
description carefully. (You may notice that ZORK
occasionally refers to a location as a ìroom,î even if
you are outdoors.) As you explore the Empire, it is
helpful to draw a map of the geography.

Instruction Manual

An important element of interactive fiction is puzzle-solving. You should think of a locked door or a
ferocious beast not as a permanent obstacle, but
merely as a puzzle to be tackled. Solving puzzles will
frequently involve bringing a certain item with you
and then using it in the proper way.
In ZORK, time passes only in response to your
input. You might imagine a clock that ticks once for
each sentence you type, and the adventure progresses only at each tick. Nothing happens until you
type a sentence and press the RETURN (or ENTER)
key, so you can plan your turns as slowly and carefully as you want.
To measure your progress, ZORK I keeps track of
your score. Youíll get points for solving puzzles,
acquiring treasures, performing certain actions and
visiting certain locations. You will also get points for
putting treasures into the trophy case. There may be
a penalty for getting ìkilled.î

Tips for Novices
1. Draw a map. It should include each location, the
directions connecting it to adjoining locations and any
interesting objects there. (See the small sample map
that goes along with the sample transcript on page
21.) Some puzzles are almost impossible to solve
without completely mapping the area. Note that
there are 10 possible directions, plus IN and OUT.
And since some passages twist and curve, going
NORTH from Place A to Place B doesnít always mean
that SOUTH will take you back to Place A.
2. Most objects that you can pick up are important,
either as treasures or as solutions to puzzles, or
both!
3. Save your place often. That way, if you mess up
or get ìkilled,î you wonít have to start over from the
beginning. See page 16 for instructions.
4. Read carefully. There are often clues in the descriptions of locations and objects, as well as in labels, engravings, books and so on. Even strange or
dangerous actions may provide clues and might
prove to be fun! You can always save your position
first if you want. Hereís a fun example:
> PUT ON THE GREEN CALICO HAT
The munchkins giggle, but remain unconvinced that
youíre a witch.
Youíve just learned there is something which might
convince the munchkins that youíre a witch. They
might even give you their enchanted broom. Perhaps
if you put on that blue calico dress you came across
earlier in the storyÖ

5. Unlike other ìadventure gamesî that you may
have played, there are many possible routes to the
end of ZORK. Some puzzles have more than one
solution; other puzzles donít need to be solved at all.
Sometimes you will have to solve one puzzle in order
to obtain the item(s) or information you need to solve
another puzzle.
6. You may find it helpful to explore ZORK with another person. Different people may find different
puzzles easy and can often complement each other.
7. If you really have difficulty, you can order a hint
booklet and a complete map using the order form in
your package. You donít need the hint booklet to
enjoy the story, but it will make solving ZORK I
easier.
8. Read the sample transcript on page 21 to get a feel
for how Infocomís interactive fiction works.
9. You can word a command in many different ways.
For example, to turn the brass lantern on, you could
use any of the following:
> LIGHT LAMP.
> TURN ON THE LAMP.
> TURN THE LAMP ON.
> ACTIVATE THE LAMP.
> LIGHT THE BRASS LANTERN.
In fact, if the lamp is the only light source present,
just typing LIGHT is enough, since ZORK will assume you meant the lamp. But more about that in
the next section...

Communicating with ZORK
In ZORK, you type your sentence in plain English
each time you see the prompt (>). ZORK usually
acts as if your sentence begins ìI want to...,î although you shouldnít actually type those words. You
can use the words like ìTHEî if you want, and you can
use capital letters if you want; ZORK doesnít care
either way.
When you finish typing a sentence, press the RETURN (or ENTER) key and ZORK will process your
request. ZORK will respond, telling you whether your
request is possible at this point in the story and what
happened as a result.
ZORK recognizes your words by their first six
letters, and all subsequent letters are ignored.
Therefore, CANDLE, CANDLEs and CANDLEstick
would all be treated as the same word by ZORK.
To move around, just type the desired direction.
You can use the eight compass directions: NORTH,
SOUTH, EAST, WEST, NORTHEAST, NORTHWEST,
SOUTHEAST and SOUTHWEST. You can abbreviate
these to N, S, E, W, NE, NW, SE and SW, respectively. You can use UP (or U) and DOWN (or D). IN
and OUT will also work in certain places.

ZORK understands many different kinds of sentences. Here are several examples. (Note that some
of these objects do not actually appear in ZORK.)
> WALK NORTH
> DOWN
> NE
> GO SOUTH
>U
> TAKE BOX
> PICK UP THE WOODEN BOX
> DROP IT
> PUSH THE BUTTON
> OPEN THE WOODEN DOOR
> EXAMINE THE SCUBA GEAR
> LOOK BEHIND THE STATUE
> LOOK UNDER THE ROCK
> LOOK INSIDE THE BUBBLING CAULDRON
> KILL THE BEAR WITH THE GUN
> SHOOT BEAR WITH LARGE RIFLE
You can use multiple objects with certain verbs if
you separate them by the word AND or by a comma.
Some examples:
> TAKE LAMP, JAR, FLUTE
> DROP THE DAGGER, LANCE, AND MACE
> PUT THE GOLD BAR AND THE PEARL IN THE
TROPHY CASE
The word ALL refers to every visible object except
those inside something else. If there were an apple
on the ground and an orange inside a cabinet, TAKE
ALL would take the apple but not the orange.
> TAKE ALL
> TAKE ALL THE BOOKS
> TAKE ALL FROM THE DESK
> GIVE ALL BUT THE PENCIL TO THE NYMPH
> DROP ALL EXCEPT THE DART GUN

14

Instruction Manual

You can include several sentences on one input
line if you separate them by the word THEN or by a
period. (Note that each sentence will still count as a
turn.) You donít need a period at the end of the input
line. For example, you could type all of the following
at once, before pressing the RETURN (or ENTER)
key:

ZORK tries to guess what you really mean when
you don't give enough information. For example, if
you say that you want to do something, but not what
you want to do it to or with, ZORK will sometimes
decide that there is only one possible object that you
could mean. When it does so, it will tell you. For
example:

> NORTH.READ THE BOOK.DROP IT THEN BURN
IT WITH TORCH

> BURN THE KINDLING
(with the torch)
The kindling catches fire and is consumed.
or
> GIVE THE SWORD
(to the gnome)
The gnome, a sworn pacifist, refuses to take it.

If ZORK doesnít understand one of the sentences in
your input line, or if something unusual happens, it
will ignore the rest of your input line (see ìZORK
Complaintsî on page 20).
There are only two kinds of questions that ZORK
understands: WHAT and WHERE. Here are two
examples that you can actually try in ZORK:
> WHAT IS A GRUE?
> WHERE IS THE ZORKMID?
You will meet other people and creatures as you
explore ZORK. You can ìtalkî to some of these
beings by typing their name, then a comma,
then whatever you want them to do. Here are
some examples:
> GNOME, GIVE ME THE KEY
> TREE SPRITE, OPEN THE SECRET DOOR
> JOEL, WAIT HERE
> WARLOCK, TAKE THE SPELL SCROLL
THEN FOLLOW ME
> MIKE, NORTH.GET THE BRAN MUFFIN.
THROW IT AT THE DWARF
Notice that in the last two examples, you are giving
one person more than one command on the same
input line.
You can use quotes to answer a question or say
something ìout loud.î For example:
> SAY ìHELLO SAILORî
> ANSWER ìA ZEBRAî

If your sentence is ambiguous, ZORK will ask
what you really mean. You can answer most of these
questions briefly by supplying the missing information, rather than typing the entire input again. You
can do this only at the very next prompt. Some examples:
> TIE THE ROPE
What do you want to tie the rope to?
> THE MAST
The rope is now tied to the mast.
or
> HIT THE NAIL WITH THE HAMMER
Which nail do you mean, the shiny nail or the rusty
nail?
> SHINY
The shiny nail is driven halfway into the piece of
wood.
ZORK uses many words in its descriptions that it
will not recognize in your sentences. For example,
you might read, ìAbove you, moonlit clouds flit
across the evening sky.î However, if ZORK doesnít
recognize the words SKY or CLOUDS in your input,
you can assume that the sky and clouds are not important to your completion of the story, except to
provide you with a more vivid description of where
you are or what is going on. ZORK recognizes over
600 words, nearly all that you are likely to use in
your sentences. If ZORK doesnít know a word you
used, or any of its common synonyms, you are almost certainly trying something that is not important
in your adventure.

Starting and Stopping
Starting the story: Now that you know what to expect
when you venture into the caverns of ZORK, itís
time for you to ìbootî your disk. To load ZORK,
follow the instructions on the Reference Card in your
ZORK I package.
Following the copyright notice and the release
number of the story, you will see a description of the
place where the story begins.
Hereís a quick exercise to help you get accustomed to interacting with ZORK I. Try the following
command first:
> OPEN THE MAILBOX
Then press the RETURN (or ENTER) key. ZORK I
will respond with:
Opening the mailbox reveals a leaflet.
Now try:
> READ THE LEAFLET
After you press the RETURN (or ENTER) key, ZORK
I will respond:
(Taken)
Welcome to ZORK!
ZORK is a story of adventure, danger and low cunning.
In it you will explore some of the most amazing territory
ever seen by mortals. No computer should be without
one.

Instruction Manual

Saving and restoring: It will probably take you many
days to complete ZORK I. Using the SAVE feature,
you can continue at a later time without having to
start over from the beginning, just as you can place a
bookmark in a book you are reading. SAVE puts a
ìsnapshotî of your place in the story onto another
diskette. If you are a cautious adventurer, you may
want to save your place before (or after) trying
something dangerous or tricky. That way, you can go
back to that position later, even if you have gotten
lost or ìkilledî since then.
To save your place in the story, type SAVE at the
prompt (>), and then press the RETURN (or ENTER)
key. Then follow the instructions for saving and restoring on your Reference Card. Some systems require a blank disk, initialized and formatted, for
saves. Using a disk with data on it (not counting
other ZORK saves) may result in the loss of that data,
depending on your system.
You can restore a saved position any time you
want. To do so, type RESTORE at the prompt (>),
and press the RETURN (or ENTER) key. Then follow
the instructions on your Reference Card. You can
then continue the story from the point where you
used the SAVE command. You can type LOOK for a
description of where you are.
Quitting and restarting: If you want to start over
from the beginning of the story, type RESTART.
(This is usually faster than re-booting.) Just to make
sure, ZORK will ask if you really want to start over.
If you do, type Y or YES, and press the RETURN
(or ENTER) key.
If you want to stop, type QUIT. Once again,
ZORK will ask if this is really what you want to do.
If you do, type Y and press the RETURN key.
Remember when you RESTART or QUIT: if you
want to be able to return to your current position, you
must first do a SAVE.

Appendix A
Quick Reference Guide
The object of ZORK I is to find the treasures of the
Great Underground Empire and put them in your
trophy case.

3. Important! After typing your sentence or command, you must press the RETURN (or ENTER) key
before ZORK will respond.

1. To start the story (ìboot upî), see the separate
Reference Card in your ZORK package.

4. On most computers, your screen will have a special line called the status line. It tells you the name
of your current location, your score, and the number
of turns you have taken.

2. When you see the prompt (>) on your screen,
ZORK is waiting for your command. There are
four kinds of sentences or commands that ZORK
understands:

5. You can pick up and carry many of the items youíll
find in the story. For example, if you type TAKE THE
NECKLACE, you will be carrying it. Type INVENTORY to see a list of everything you are carrying.

A. Direction commands: To move from place to
place, just type the direction you want to go: N (or
NORTH), E, S, W, NE, SE, NW, SW, U (or UP),
D, IN, OUT.
B. Actions: Just type whatever you want to do.
Some examples: READ THE BOOK or OPEN THE
DOOR or LOOK THROUGH THE WINDOW.
Once youíre familiar with simple commands,
youíll want to use more complex ones as described
in ìCommunicating with ZORKî on page 14.

6. When you want to stop, save your place for later,
or start over, read the ìStarting and Stoppingî section on page 16.
7. If you have trouble, refer to the specific section of
the manual for more detailed instructions.

C. Commands given to people: To talk to characters in the story, type their name, then a comma,
then what you want to say to them. For example:
TROLL, GIVE ME THE AXE or OLD MAN, GO
NORTH.
D. Special one-word commands: some one-word
commands, such as INVENTORY or DIAGNOSE,
give you specific information or affect your output.
A list of these appears in the ìImportant Commandsî appendix on page 18.

Appendix B
Important Commands
There are a number of one-word commands which
you can type instead of a sentence. You can use them
over and over as needed. Some count as a turn,
others do not. Type the command after the prompt
(>) and hit the RETURN (or ENTER) key.
AGAINóZORK will usually respond as if you had
repeated your previous sentence. Among the cases
where AGAIN will not work is if you were just talking
to another character. You can abbreviate AGAIN to
G.
BRIEFóThis tells ZORK to give you the full description of a location only the first time you enter it. On
subsequent visits, ZORK will tell you only the name
of the location and the objects present. This is how
ZORK will normally act, unless you tell it otherwise
using the VERBOSE or SUPERBRIEF commands.

DIAGNOSEóZORK will give you a medical report
of your physical condition. This is particularly useful if
you have just survived a dangerous battle or if you are
under the effects of a magical spell.
INVENTORYóZORK will list what you are carrying. You can abbreviate INVENTORY to I.
LOOKóThis tells ZORK to describe your location in
full detail. You can abbreviate LOOK to L.
QUITóThis lets you stop. If you want to save your
position before quitting, follow the instructions in
ìStarting and Stoppingî on page 16. You can abbreviate QUIT to Q.
RESTARTóThis stops the story and starts over from
the beginning.
RESTOREóThis restores a story position made using
the SAVE command. See ìStarting and Stoppingî for
more details.
SAVEóThis makes a ìsnapshotî of your current
story position onto your storage disk. You can return
to a saved position in the future using the RESTORE
command. See ìStarting and Stoppingî for more
details.
SCOREóZORK will show your current score and
the number of turns you have taken. It will also tell
you your rank, which is based on your score.

18

Instruction Manual

SCRIPTóThis command tells your printer to begin
making a transcript of the story as you venture onwards. A transcript may aid your memory but is not
necessary. It will work only on certain computers;
read your Reference Card for details.
SUPERBRIEFóThis commands ZORK to display only
the name of a place you have entered, even if you
have never been there before. In this mode, ZORK
will not even mention which objects are present. Of
course, you can always get a description of your
location, and the items there, by typing LOOK. In
SUPERBRIEF mode, the blank line between turns will
be eliminated. This mode is meant for adventurers
who are already very familiar with the geography.
Also see VERBOSE and BRIEF.
UNSCRIPTóThis commands your printer to stop
making a transcript.
VERBOSEóThis tells ZORK that you want a complete description of each location and the objects in it
every time you enter a location, even if youíve been
there before. Also see BRIEF and SUPERBRIEF.
VERSIONóZORK responds by showing you the
release number and the serial number of your copy of
the story. Please include this information if you ever
report a ìbugî in ZORK.
WAITóThis will cause time in the story to pass.
Normally, between turns, nothing happens in the
story. You could leave your computer, take a nap and
return to the story to find that nothing has changed.
You can use WAIT to make time pass in the story
without doing anything. For example, if you encounter an alien being, you could WAIT to see what it will
do. Or, if you are in a moving vehicle, you could
WAIT to see where it will go. You can abbreviate
WAIT to Z.

Appendix C
Some Recognized Verbs
This is only a partial list of the verbs that all three
ZORK adventures understand. There are many

Appendix D
ZORK Complaints
ZORK will complain if you type a sentence that confuses it completely. ZORK will then ignore the rest
of the input line. (Unusual events, such as being
attacked, may also cause ZORK to ignore the rest of
the sentences you typed, since the event may have
changed your situation drastically.) Some of ZORKís
complaints:
I DONíT KNOW THE WORD ì(your word).î The
word you typed is not in the storyís vocabulary.
Sometimes using a synonym or rephrasing will help.
If not, ZORK probably doesnít know the idea you
were trying to get across.
YOU USED THE WORD ì(your word)î IN A WAY
THAT I DONíT UNDERSTAND. ZORK knows the
word you typed, but couldnít use it in that sense.
Usually this is because ZORK knows the word as a
different part of speech. For example, if you typed
PRESS THE LOWER BUTTON, you are using LOWER
as an adjective, but ZORK might know LOWER only
as a verb, as in LOWER THE ROPE.
THAT SENTENCE ISNíT ONE I RECOGNIZE. The
sentence you typed may have been gibberish, such
as GIVE TROLL WITH SWORD. Or, you may have
typed a reasonable sentence but used a syntax that
ZORK does not recognize, such as SMELL UNDER
THE ROCK. Try rephrasing the sentence.

THERE WAS NO VERB IN THAT SENTENCE! Unless
you are answering a question, each sentence must
have a verb (or a command) in it somewhere.
THERE SEEMS TO BE A NOUN MISSING IN THAT
SENTENCE! This usually means that your sentence
was incomplete, such as EAT THE BLUE.
THERE WERE TOO MANY NOUNS IN THAT SENTENCE. An example is PUT THE SOUP IN THE BOWL
WITH THE LADLE, which has three noun ìphrases,î
one more than ZORK can digest in a single action.
I BEG YOUR PARDON? You hit the RETURN
(or ENTER) key without typing anything.
ITíS TOO DARK TO SEE. In the story, there was not
enough light to perform your action.
I DONíT SEE WHAT YOU ARE REFERRING TO. You
used HIM, HER or IT, but ZORK isnít sure what person or object you meant.
YOU CANíT SEE ANY ì(object)î HERE! The item
you referred to was not visible. It may be somewhere else, inside a closed container, and so on.
THE OTHER OBJECT(S) THAT YOU MENTIONED
ISNíT (ARENíT) HERE. You referred to two or more
items in the same sentence, and at least one of them
wasnít visible to you in your present location.
YOU CANíT GO THAT WAY. There was no passage
or exit in the direction you tried to move.
YOU CANíT USE MULTIPLE (IN)DIRECT OBJECTS
WITH ì(your verb).î You can refer to several items
at the same time only with certain verbs. Among the
more useful of these verbs are TAKE, DROP and PUT.
This restriction also applies to the use of ALL, as in
DROP ALL. For example, ATTACK will not work with
multiple objects; you couldnít say ATTACK ALL or
ATTACK THE WARLOCK AND THE ENCHANTER.
