# Changelog v1.5.3 - Critic Rejection Handling Fix

## Date: 2025-01-26

## Problem Addressed
The agent was getting stuck in loops where it would repeatedly propose the same action even after critic rejection, leading to turn skipping. Analysis of logs showed:
- Agent proposing "east" multiple times despite rejection
- Agent proposing "examine wooden door" repeatedly 
- System skipping turns after exhausting 3 retry attempts
- Agent not effectively using critic feedback to diversify actions

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Agent not adapting to rejection feedback**: The rejection context was being passed but not effectively used
2. **Limited action diversity**: Agent had a narrow repertoire of actions it would consider
3. **No fallback mechanism**: When stuck, the agent would just repeat the same failed actions
4. **Insufficient context**: Agent didn't have clear visibility of available alternatives

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Agent Prompt (agent.md)
Added a new section "CRITICAL - HANDLING CRITIC REJECTIONS" that provides explicit instructions:
- Never propose the same rejected action again
- Read and understand the critic's justification
- Switch to different categories of actions (movement → examination → interaction)
- Prioritize unexplored alternatives
- Clear examples of what to avoid and what to try instead

### 2. Improved Context Building (zork_orchestrator.py)
Added `_build_agent_context()` method that:
- Always includes available exits from current location
- Lists visible objects that can be interacted with
- Provides rejection context with helpful hints
- Suggests alternative action categories based on what was rejected

### 3. Fallback Action System (zork_orchestrator.py)
Added `_get_fallback_action()` method that activates after 2 failed attempts:
- Priority 1: Take any untaken items (highest value actions)
- Priority 2: Try unexplored exits
- Priority 3: Examine unexamined objects
- Priority 4: Test standard directions not in exits list
- Priority 5: Basic "look" command as last resort

### 4. Modified Rejection Retry Logic
- First rejection: Let agent try again with enhanced context
- Second rejection: Invoke fallback action system
- Third rejection: Skip turn (should be rare now)

## Expected Improvements
1. **Reduced turn skipping**: Should drop from frequent to rare occurrences
2. **Better action diversity**: Agent will try different categories of actions
3. **More consistent progress**: Less time stuck in repetitive loops
4. **Smarter exploration**: Fallback system ensures productive actions

## Technical Details
- No changes to critic evaluation logic (working as intended)
- No changes to rejection threshold (remains at -0.05)
- Backward compatible with existing save files
- All changes are in prompt engineering and orchestration logic

## Testing Recommendations
1. Run episodes in locations with limited exits to test rejection handling
2. Monitor turn skip frequency compared to v1.5.2
3. Verify fallback actions are reasonable and productive
4. Check that agent properly switches action categories after rejection

## Future Enhancements (Phase 2)
1. Add suggested_alternatives field to CriticResponse
2. Implement learning from successful actions
3. Add more sophisticated action diversity metrics
4. Consider dynamic rejection threshold adjustment

## Files Modified
- `agent.md`: Added rejection handling instructions
- `zork_orchestrator.py`: Added context building and fallback system
- `critic_rejection_fix.py`: Patch script to apply changes

## How to Apply
Run: `python critic_rejection_fix.py` from the ZorkGPT directory

This will:
1. Create timestamped backups of modified files
2. Apply all changes automatically
3. Report success/failure status
