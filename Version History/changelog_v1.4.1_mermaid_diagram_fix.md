# Changelog v1.4.1 - Context Summarization Fixes

## Date: 2025-06-26

## Overview
Fixed critical errors that were preventing context summarization from working properly:
1. Method name mismatch for Mermaid diagram generation
2. AttributeError when accessing summarized memories stored as dictionaries

## Problem
When the context overflow detection triggered (at approximately 24,000+ tokens), the system attempted to generate a summarization that included a visual representation of the game map. However, the code was calling `self.game_map.generate_mermaid_diagram()` which didn't exist in the `MapGraph` class, causing the summarization to fail with the error:
```
'MapGraph' object has no attribute 'generate_mermaid_diagram'
```

## Solutions

### 1. Mermaid Diagram Method Fix
Updated the method call in `zork_orchestrator.py` from:
```python
{self.game_map.generate_mermaid_diagram()}
```
to:
```python
{self.game_map.render_mermaid()}
```

### 2. Memory Access Compatibility Fix
Updated `get_relevant_memories_for_prompt` in `zork_agent.py` to handle both object attributes and dictionary access patterns. After summarization, memories are stored as dictionaries, but the code was only expecting objects with attributes.

Added compatibility checks:
```python
# Handle both object attributes and dictionary access
if hasattr(obs, 'current_location_name'):
    location_name = obs.current_location_name
elif isinstance(obs, dict) and 'current_location_name' in obs:
    location_name = obs['current_location_name']
```

## Files Modified
- `zork_orchestrator.py` (line 2462) - Fixed Mermaid diagram method name
- `zork_agent.py` (lines 604-633) - Added dictionary/object compatibility for memory access

## Impact
- Context summarization will now work correctly when token limits are exceeded
- The system can properly generate Mermaid diagrams of the game map for visualization
- Prevents the accumulation of excessive context that was occurring due to failed summarizations

## Technical Details
The `MapGraph` class in `map_graph.py` provides a `render_mermaid()` method that generates a Mermaid diagram representation of the game's map structure. This visualization is used during context summarization to provide a compact representation of the explored game world.

## Performance Impact of the Bug

This bug had severe performance consequences:

1. **Exponential Context Growth**: Without successful summarization, context grew unbounded from ~24,000 tokens to over 100,000 tokens (4x increase)

2. **Degraded Response Quality**: Excessive context leads to:
   - Attention dilution across too many tokens
   - Difficulty focusing on relevant recent information
   - Increased likelihood of hallucinations or confusion

3. **Increased Costs**: API costs scale with token usage, resulting in roughly 4x higher costs per API call

4. **Slower Response Times**: Larger contexts increase both processing time and network transfer time

5. **Risk of Hard Failures**: Without summarization, the agent would eventually hit LLM context limits (e.g., 128k tokens) and crash

6. **Memory Pressure**: Storing 100k+ tokens vs 24k tokens significantly increases RAM usage

7. **Inefficient Game State Tracking**: Redundant information accumulates without consolidation, potentially causing the agent to lose track of important early-game discoveries
