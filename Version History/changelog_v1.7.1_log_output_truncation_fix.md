# Changelog v1.7.1 - Log Output Truncation Fix

## Date: 2025-06-30

## Issue Description
Users reported that the ZorkGPT debug logs and exported game state were missing full LLM responses for debugging purposes. Specifically:

- **Debug console output** was truncating LLM responses at 500 characters  
- **Reasoning chains** were truncated at 200 characters in debug logs
- **Recent game log export** was missing `reasoning`, `critic_score`, and `critic_justification` fields for older turns
- This made debugging LLM behavior difficult, as the full thought processes were not visible

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Action Reasoning History Truncation
**Location**: `zork_orchestrator.py` lines 2605-2606

During context summarization, the system was only preserving the **last 10 entries** in `action_reasoning_history`:

```python
# Problematic code:
recent_reasoning = self.action_reasoning_history[-10:] if len(self.action_reasoning_history) > 10 else self.action_reasoning_history
self.action_reasoning_history = recent_reasoning
```

**Problem**: The `get_recent_log()` method exports 20 turns by default, but only 10 reasoning entries were preserved during summarization, causing turns 11-20 back to lose their reasoning data.

### Secondary Issues: Debug Log Truncation
**Location**: `zork_agent.py` lines 369 and 460

Debug logging was truncating LLM responses for console readability:

```python
# Raw response truncation:
f"[DEBUG] Raw agent response: {raw_response[:500]}{'...' if len(raw_response) > 500 else ''}"

# Reasoning truncation:  
f"[DEBUG] Final reasoning result: {reasoning[:200]}{'...' if len(reasoning) > 200 else ''}"
```

**Problem**: This prevented users from seeing complete LLM responses and full reasoning chains for debugging purposes.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Increased Action Reasoning History Preservation
**File**: `zork_orchestrator.py` - Lines 2604-2607

**Before**:
```python
# Reset action reasoning history but preserve recent critic scores
recent_reasoning = self.action_reasoning_history[-10:] if len(self.action_reasoning_history) > 10 else self.action_reasoning_history
self.action_reasoning_history = recent_reasoning
```

**After**:
```python
# Reset action reasoning history but preserve recent critic scores  
# Keep 25 entries to ensure full export coverage (get_recent_log exports 20 by default)
recent_reasoning = self.action_reasoning_history[-25:] if len(self.action_reasoning_history) > 25 else self.action_reasoning_history
self.action_reasoning_history = recent_reasoning
```

**Benefits**:
- **Full export coverage**: Ensures all 20 exported turns have reasoning data
- **Buffer for safety**: 25 entries provide margin for export size changes
- **Memory efficient**: Still limits growth while preserving necessary data

### 2. Removed Debug Log Truncation
**File**: `zork_agent.py` - Lines 369 and 460

#### Raw Response Logging Fix
**Before**:
```python
f"[DEBUG] Raw agent response: {raw_response[:500]}{'...' if len(raw_response) > 500 else ''}"
```

**After**:
```python
f"[DEBUG] Raw agent response: {raw_response}"
```

#### Reasoning Logging Fix
**Before**:
```python
f"[DEBUG] Final reasoning result: {reasoning[:200]}{'...' if len(reasoning) > 200 else ''}"
```

**After**:
```python
f"[DEBUG] Final reasoning result: {reasoning}"
```

**Benefits**:
- **Complete visibility**: Full LLM responses visible in debug output
- **Better debugging**: No information loss for troubleshooting
- **Consistent logging**: All log entries show complete data

## Technical Implementation Details

### Context Summarization Impact
The fix addresses the core issue where context summarization was inadvertently truncating debugging information. The system performs summarization to manage memory usage, but the previous limit was too restrictive for debugging needs.

### Memory Considerations
- **Before**: 10 reasoning entries preserved (~1-2KB typical)
- **After**: 25 reasoning entries preserved (~3-5KB typical)
- **Impact**: Minimal memory increase with significant debugging improvement

### Export Consistency
The fix ensures that the exported `current_state.json` file contains complete reasoning data for all recent turns, enabling:
- **Full debugging workflows**: Complete LLM thought processes visible
- **Better error analysis**: No truncated reasoning chains
- **Improved monitoring**: Full visibility into agent decision-making

## Files Modified

### Core Changes
- **`zork_orchestrator.py`**: Increased reasoning history preservation from 10 to 25 entries
- **`zork_agent.py`**: Removed truncation limits from debug logging (2 locations)

### No Configuration Changes Required
- **Automatic improvement**: All fixes apply automatically
- **Backwards compatible**: No breaking changes to existing functionality
- **No user action needed**: Improvements take effect immediately

## Verification and Testing

"recent_log": [
  {
    "turn": 33,
    "action": "examine trophy case", 
    "zork_response": "The trophy case is empty."
    // Missing: reasoning, critic_score, critic_justification
  }
]
```

### After Fix - Complete Output Example
```
[DEBUG] Raw agent response: We are in the Troll Room facing a hostile troll blocking all exits. The troll has resisted two sword attacks. According to our anti-repetition rules, we must NOT repeat "kill troll with sword" as it has failed multiple times. 

Observing the environment:
- Room features: bloodstains, deep scratches, forbidding hole to west
- Troll blocks all exits (east, south, west)
- Sword is glowing brightly (likely indicating supernatural threat)

Priority actions:
1. HIGH: Examine room features since we haven't done this yet - may reveal weaknesses or alternative paths
2. HIGH: Try different combat approach (use other inventory items) since sword attacks failed
3. AVOID: Repeating sword attacks or attempting blocked exits

Inventory items that could help:
- Garlic (folklore suggests trolls dislike garlic)
- Lantern (light might deter troll)
- Bottle of water (possible distraction)

First action: Examine the hole to west since it's specifically described as "forbidding" and might offer an escape route or tactical advantage.

[DEBUG] Final reasoning result: We are in the Troll Room facing a hostile troll blocking all exits. The troll has resisted two sword attacks. According to our anti-repetition rules, we must NOT repeat "kill troll with sword" as it has failed multiple times...
