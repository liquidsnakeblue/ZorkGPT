>		    Welcome to Dungeon!

   Dungeon is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning.  In it
you will explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortal
man.  Hardened adventurers have run screaming from the terrors contained
within.

   In Dungeon, the intrepid explorer delves into the forgotten secrets
of a lost labyrinth deep in the bowels of the earth, searching for
vast treasures long hidden from prying eyes, treasures guarded by
fearsome monsters and diabolical traps!

   No DECsystem should be without one!

   Dungeon was created at the Programming Technology Division of the MIT
Laboratory for Computer Science by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce
Daniels, and Dave Lebling.  It was inspired by the Adventure game of
Crowther and Woods, and the Dungeons and Dragons game of Gygax
and Arneson.  The original version was written in MDL (alias MUDDLE).
The current version was translated from MDL into FORTRAN IV by
a somewhat paranoid DEC engineer who prefers to remain anonymous,
and was later translated to C.

   On-line information may be obtained with the commands HELP and INFO.

		Flood Control Dam #3

  Flood control dam #3 (FCD #3) was constructed in year 783 of the
Great Underground Empire to harness the destructive power of the
Frigid River.  This work was supported by a grant of 37 million
zorkmids from the central bureaucracy and your own omnipotent local
tyrant Lord Dimwit Flathead the Excessive.  This impressive structure
is composed of 3.7 cubic feet of concrete, is 256 feet tall at the
center, and 193 feet wide at the top.  The reservoir created behind
the dam has a volume of 37 billion cubic feet, an area of 12 million
square feet, and a shore line of 36 thousand feet.

  The construction of FCD #3 took 112 days from ground breaking to
the dedication.  It required a work force of 384 slaves, 34 slave
drivers, 12 engineers, 2 turtle doves, and a partridge in a pear
tree.  The work was managed by a command team composed of 234
bureaucrats, 2347 secretaries (at least two of whom could type),
12,256 paper shufflers, 52,469 rubber stampers, 245,193 red tape
processors, and nearly one million dead trees.

  We will now point out some of the more interesting features of
FCD #3 as we conduct you on a guided tour of the facilities.
